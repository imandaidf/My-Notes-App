# My Notes Web Application

A simple and intuitive web-based notes application that allows users to create, view, and manage notes with rich text content, including the ability to embed images directly within the text. Notes are stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Create notes with formatted text using a `contenteditable` area.
- **Image Embedding**:
  - **Drag & Drop**: Easily drag image files from your computer directly into the note input area.
  - **Paste Images**: Paste images from your clipboard (e.g., screenshots, copied images from websites) directly into the note input.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All your notes are automatically saved in your browser's `localStorage`, ensuring they remain available even after closing and reopening the browser.
- **Dynamic Display**: Notes are rendered dynamically on the page as they are added, with the newest notes appearing at the top.
- **Delete Notes**: Each note includes a "Delete" button for easy removal.
- **Search Notes**: Instantly filter and search your notes by typing keywords into the search box at the top of the app.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a clean and responsive user interface across different device sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the core structure of the web application.
- **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS)**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers all the interactive functionalities, including note management, image handling, and local storage integration.
